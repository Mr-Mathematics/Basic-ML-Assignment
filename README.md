# Basic-ML-Assignment

Solve a machine learning problem that interests you! This is an open-ended assignment. You should not use deep learning frameworks for this exercise (you can use scikit-learn (Links to an external site.) to have access to tons of other machine learning algorithms).

You can find a lot of datasets here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets (Links to an external site.)

Do some preliminary exploratory analysis of your data (like we did in lecture 10.01).

You should upload a Jupyter notebook where the experiments are already completed (you have the output of the cells in the notebook).
